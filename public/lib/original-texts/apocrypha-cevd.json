And if you really love to study the Scriptures, it is very important for you to be able to explain them to others, whether by talking or by writing. That's why my grandfather Jesus studied the Scriptures until he became an expert, then wrote this book to help others learn about wisdom. So if you love to learn, you should study this book, and you will come closer and closer to living as the Law requires. But I ask you to read with a good attitude and not to be critical of my translation. I worked hard at it, so be understanding in those places where it isn't perfect. The meaning of any Hebrew book changes a little when it is translated, whether it is from the Law or the Prophets or is one of the other books in the Scriptures. I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of King Euergetes, and I stayed there for as long as he was king.<sup>[2]</sup> While I was there, I studied copies of many books, and that's when I realized I should translate this one. Translating carefully takes a lot of hard work, and I spent many sleepless nights before my translation was completed. And now that it is finished, those who live outside of Judea can read this book to learn how best to obey God's Law in their own lives. <sup>ⓐ</sup> Only the Lord can give Wisdom,<br> and his Wisdom lasts forever.<br>"
